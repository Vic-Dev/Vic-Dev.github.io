# A little about myself...

An accurate depiction of my cat: ![Cat]({{ site.url }}assets/cat.png)

Before I programmed, I thought about people! I have an H.B.Sc. in Psychology from U of T. After school, I worked as a behavioural therapist working with children with autism. 

I have always been a problem solver, and this is what ultimately led me to programming. Now, I build web apps, and responsive and custom styled sites. Ultimately, any new technology interests and excites me to create and build new things.
